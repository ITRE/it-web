# ITRE Equipment and Logging

## Master List
A master list of ITRE computers in the system in currently on the ITRE273 server. This sheet only accounts for items in the ITRE network and does not account for peripherals or new computers that have not been set up. Some kind of list or inventory should be made of these items in the future. It is important that the location of these devices is known and the record kept up to date. In the event of an audit, the ITRE IT Manager is responsible for accounting for all items purchased by ITRE.

## CAMS and Risk Assessment
CAMs accounts for high cost items at ITRE. This, along with the master device list, should be used to generate a yearly risk assessment report to be used for insurance purposes. The ITRE IT Manager should coordinate with the Director of Finance and Administration in creating and submitting this list to the university.

## IAM / AD
Identity Access Management at ITRE controls computer and server access for staff, students and temporary workers, and instructors or guests of ITRE.

::: warning WolfTech AD
A move to WolfTech AD has been proposed and may be instituted in the near future, but it is important to understand that this move only removes the technical support responsibilities from ITRE, not the managerial responsibilities. ITRE IT & Web will still need to manage users and policies for the department, understand how Active Directory works, and coordinate with University technical staff.
