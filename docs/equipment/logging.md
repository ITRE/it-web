# Records

## Borrowing
Staff will from time to time ask for equipment to borrow for a period of time. IT & Web is responsible for having these items on hand as well as keeping track of who is borrowing them.

::: warning Take Home Use
Equipment taken from ITRE for longer than 30 days must have an accompanying CA-2 Form, per University policy. ITRE IT & Web should keep the original of this form and provide a copy to both the employee and the Director of Finance and Administration for their records.

## Moving
Only IT & Web staff should move equipment, to limit the possibility of something breaking and to ensure that records of device locations remain accurate. Network ports not used for an extended period of time are automatically shut off by the university and may need to be reactivated if a staff member later needs that port.

## Cords and Adaptors
There is currently no accurate record of the cords, adaptors, and other peripherals at ITRE, nor is there any system for identifying these items.
