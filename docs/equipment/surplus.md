# Surplus and Removal

## Training
Surplus disposition is handled by a department Asset Management Coordinator. A member of the IT & Web team may be asked to take on this role, as they are often the best suited for determining the usability of ITRE devices. To become an AM Coordinator you must register for the [FIN101 - Asset Management Session](https://reporter.ncsu.edu/link/courseview?courseID=FIN-CAM-101&deptName=FIN) course in Reporter, as well as request access to surplus in the financial system from the SAR Administrator. More information can be found on the [NCSU Materials Management Website](https://materialsmgmt.ofa.ncsu.edu/our-services/surplus/disposal/).

## Backlog
ITRE currently has a backlog of equipment in need of disposition. The majority of this equipment has been put in the closet by the elevators and can be accessed with the IT key. Equipment slotted for surplus before the departure of the previous IT team are labeled with post-it notes containing any additional information required for disposition.
