# Forms and Materials

## Posters

It's important to check the size of the paper loaded in the plotter before attempting to print a poster or other large format materials. The width of this roll will be the maximum size of one side of your print. It's also a good idea to print from a PDF rather than the powerpoint, image file, or other file type. This helps make sure the printed product looks the same as what you see on the screen.

I have found the best luck in consistent printing by using the system dialogue rather than a program print dialogue, but this is personal preference. Plan time to run a number of test prints in the event that your poster does not print perfectly the first time. Also keep in mind that the paper we use is going to be much thinner than a nice poster from a print shop, so you may prefer to take your file outside of ITRE if a high quality appearance is important.

## Powerpoint Presentations

Powerpoint templates can be found on the public server. If not using a template, please be sure to include both the ITRE logo and the NCSU logo. Powerpoints sent off for print should be saved as PDFs first to ensure that images and fonts are included properly.

## Take Home Equipment

Equipment taken home should have an accompanying CA-2 Form. This ensures a record of any ITRE equipment not found on premise in the event of an audit and also provides an inventory of items to collect in the event a staff member leaves ITRE. Keep the original of this form for IT records and also provide a copy to both the employee and the Director of Finance and Administration for their records.
