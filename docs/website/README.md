## Staff and News

<ImageEmbed name="Staff Admin Page Screenshot" preview="staff" classes="right" />

The staff page is a custom page template in the child theme which uses ACF Pro to collect and display information about staff members. All ITRE staff should have their photo taken, preferably against the brick half-wall by the outdoor patio tables, and added to the website. A PDF resume can be included at the staff member's request.

ITRE News is handled by Wordpress's built-in posts and displayed on the homepage using a custom widget. News articles should include appropriate sized images with accessible alt text.
