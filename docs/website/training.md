# Training and Classes

## Calendar
The training calendar is handled by Simple Calendar and a Google Calendar. Access to the itre-information calendar is shared with any staff members who organize trainings. Training events automatically roll off of the website once they have passed.

Events should never be added through the wordpress dashboard. All changes to content should be made through the google calendar. If you do not see a change you have made, please wait up to two hours as the website is a cached version of the google calendar and may take time to reflect any changes.

Specific course listings can be added to the calendar only, since calendar events will automatically be removed from the website once the class has passed. It is also important to use the CashNet link provided by the CashNet team rather than the URL copied from the browser.
