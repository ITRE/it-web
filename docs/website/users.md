# Users and Editors
Several ITRE staff members have accounts and manage their own pages content on the website. New users can be added by creating accounts whose username matches the staff member's unity login and setting the account type to Unity. This user will have control over any pages for which they are the author.

## Shibboleth
Unity login is made possible by the Multi-Auth plugin. This plugin is no longer supported by NC State and an alternative should be implemented.
